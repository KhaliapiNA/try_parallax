# try_parallax
The application is finished. In this application, I wanted to play around with the possibilities of parallax. 
There are 2 background images involved here. Only the background moves to give the effect of looking out of the window. 
It works like this: position = position + (dist * speed)

Also the idea was that the text runs over the main image.
