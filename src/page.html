           <p> Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains.
               He became his family's breadwinner after his father's death,
               making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal.
               Everything changed when he came home one day to discover
               that his family was attacked and slaughtered by a demon.
               Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors of the incident,
               with Nezuko being transformed into a demon,
               but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought.
               After an encounter with Giy큰 Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps,
               Tanjiro is recruited by Giy큰 and sent to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki
               for training to also become a demon slayer,
               beginning his quest to help his sister turn into human again and avenge the death of his family.
            </p>
           <p> After two years of strenuous training,
               Tanjiro takes part in a formidable exam and is one of the few survivors to pass,
               officially making him a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.
               He begins his work of hunting down and slaying demons alongside Nezuko,
               who has been hypnotized to bring no harm to humans and who occasionally helps him in battle.
               One of Tanjiro's assignments brings him to Asakusa where he encounters Muzan Kibutsuji,
               the progenitor of all demons and the one who murdered his family. He also meets Tamayo and Yushiro,
               demons who are free from Muzan's control. Tamayo and Yushiro ally with Tanjiro
               and begin to develop a cure for Nezuko,
               though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood from the Twelve Kizuki,
               the most powerful demons under Muzan's command.
            </p>
            <p> Continuing his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira,
                fellow survivors of the exam with whom he forms an unlikely team during a battle
                with Lower Rank Six of the Kizuki. The group soon face off against Lower Rank Five of the Kizuki,
                but are ultimately outmatched; they are rescued by Giy큰 and brought back to headquarters. There,
                the Kamado siblings partake in a council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki,
                the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite members,
                who (with the exception of Giy큰) do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to live.
                However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince them to accept her. With this agreement,
                Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters significantly more resistance
                from the demons. Alongside the Hashira and Corps members,
                Tanjiro takes part in numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki,
                which they survive by narrow margins while also taking losses of their own,
                including the death of the Flame Hashira and retirement of the Sound Hashira.
                During a battle in the Swordsmith Village, it is discovered that Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight,
                a discovery that makes her the prime target of Muzan,
                who has long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being.
            </p>
            <p>Kagaya forecasts Muzan's intentions and enacts a strict training regiment of the entire Corps
                to prepare for the upcoming battle. With the blood samples obtained from the Kizuki,
                Tamayo develops a serum to cure Nezuko, who is kept isolated far from the battle as she recovers.
                Muzan soon appears before Kagaya, who triggers a suicide attack to stagger him.
                The Hashira and Tanjiro ambush Muzan, but he traps them all within Infinity Castle,
                an endless labyrinth which houses the remaining Kizuki.
                Tamayo restrains Muzan with a poison she concocted, leaving him vulnerable for attack.
                To reach him, the Corps defeat the remaining Kizuki members,
                though they take heavy losses of their own.
                Muzan kills Tamayo by absorbing her but is forced above ground by the Corps.
                A desperate battle of attrition ensues as the remainder of the Demon Slayer Corps fight
                against Muzan until the morning sun can kill him. Aided by Tamayo's poison, the Corps succeed,
                though many are killed, including all but two of the remaining Hashira,
                while Tanjiro is mortally wounded.
                Helpless against the sun,
                Muzan forcefully gives his remaining blood to a dying Tanjiro
                and transforms him into the ultimate demon in a last ditch effort to have his species survive.
                Tanjiro begins to attack the remaining Corps members,
                but through the efforts of his allies and Nezuko,
                who has been fully restored to her human self, he is turned back into a human.
            </p>

           <p> In the aftermath of the battle,
               the Corps are disbanded as the death of Muzan has effectively vanquished all other demons.
               Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their family home, accompanied by Zenitsu and Inosuke.
               Tanjiro marries fellow demon slayer Kanao Tsuyuri while Nezuko marries Zenitsu.
            </p>
            <p>In a modern-day epilogue,
                the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons.
